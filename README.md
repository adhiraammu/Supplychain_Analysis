# Supply Chain Data Analysis- DataCo Global 

## Introduction

## About the Dataset:
For this project, I worked with a dataset from Kaggle - DataCo Global, focusing on supply chain data. The dataset provides detailed insights into the company's shipment records, customer interactions, and product information. Supply chain management's key goal is to ensure that products are delivered to customers efficiently, reliably, and in a way that meets customer expectations, ultimately driving company sales and customer satisfaction. Effective supply chain analytics can improve inventory management, optimize delivery routes, and ensure better performance monitoring (DFreight, 2022).

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
The first step in the analysis process was loading the dataset and exploring its structure. The dataset contains various attributes related to customer orders, shipment details, product categories, and financial figures.

## Step 1: Data Loading
For this project, I used Python with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to handle data loading and initial exploration. Here’s a brief overview of the steps I took:
1. Pandas was used to load the CSV file into a dataframe and view the first few records to understand the dataset's structure.
2. After loading the dataset, I displayed the first five rows using df.head() to get a sense of what the data looks like, including key fields like the days for shipping, customer location, sales per customer, product categories, and delivery status. The dataset contains 53 columns, including key fields such as:
Shipping details (real and scheduled shipping days)
Product pricing and profit margins
Customer and order information
Delivery status (whether the shipment was on time or delayed)
### Descriptive Statistics:
3. Next, I used the describe() function to get a quick statistical summary of key numeric fields such as the number of orders, average sales per customer, and the total revenue generated by each transaction. This helped to identify the general distribution of the data and spot any unusual values (e.g., negative profits).
Some key descriptive statistics included:
Average sales per customer: $183.11
Maximum sales recorded: $1999.99
Average order profit: $21.97

## Step2: Data Cleaning:
Once the initial exploration was completed, I moved on to the data cleaning phase. Cleaning the data is an essential step to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis. The raw dataset had some inconsistencies, missing values, and potential outliers that could skew the results. Here's an overview of the data cleaning process I followed:
#### Handling Missing Values:
  1.I checked for any missing or null values using df.isnull().sum(). Several columns had missing data, particularly in fields related to shipment details and product descriptions. For columns where missing values were critical (such as shipment dates), I used interpolation or filled the missing data based on business logic.
  2.For non-critical fields with many missing values, such as some product attributes, I decided to drop those columns using df.dropna() to prevent any skewing of the results.
#### Dealing with Duplicates:
  3.I identified duplicate records using df.duplicated(). Duplicate records can distort analysis by giving undue weight to certain data points. Any duplicated records were dropped using df.drop_duplicates().
#### Outlier Detection:
  4.Outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of statistical models. I used box plots and the interquartile range (IQR) method to detect outliers in key numerical fields such as "sales per customer" and "order profit." Orders with extremely high values, for instance, were flagged as potential outliers. After investigation, I decided to cap some extreme outliers at reasonable thresholds to ensure that they didn't distort overall trends.
#### Standardizing Data Formats:
  5.Dates and other categorical variables were not in a standardized format. I used pd.to_datetime() to ensure all dates (e.g., order date and shipment date) were correctly formatted and could be used for time-based analysis.I also standardized text-based columns (such as customer names and product descriptions) by converting everything to lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues.
#### Correcting Data Entry Errors:
  6.I found several data entry errors, such as negative profit values or unrealistic shipment days (e.g., negative shipping durations). For these, I either corrected the errors based on domain knowledge or flagged the data points for exclusion from the analysis.
#### Removing Irrelevant Columns:
  7.Some columns, such as internal IDs or unrelated product attributes, were not relevant for my analysis. I dropped these columns to streamline the dataset and focus on the fields that were directly related to supply chain performance.
Cleaning the data improved its quality and ensured that the subsequent analysis would be based on accurate, reliable information.

## Data Visualization and Basic Analysis with Matplotlib:
I used Matplotlib, a Python library for creating static visualizations. Matplotlib is widely used for its flexibility in generating a variety of plots and charts.
Below are some of the key insights gained from visualizing the dataset using Matplotlib.

### Correlation Analysis

The correlation between key features reveals important relationships. A heatmap illustrates how various metrics, such as 'Sales per customer,' 'Order Item Discount,' and 'Order Profit Per Order,' correlate with one another. Understanding these correlations can help identify which factors most significantly impact sales performance.
Sales per customer and Order Item total are highly correlated (0.93). This suggests that as the number of items in an order increases, the sales per customer also increases.
Order Item Quantity and Order Item Product price are negatively correlated (-0.53). This implies that as the number of items in an order increases, the price of each product decreases.
Order Item Discount Rate and Order Item Discount are highly correlated (0.72). This suggests that as the discount rate increases, the discount amount also increases.
Sales and Order Item Total are highly correlated (0.92). This suggests that as the number of items in an order increases, the sales also increases.

### Customer Segmentation
